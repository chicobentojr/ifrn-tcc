It includes functionality ranging from simple mapping to exploratory data analysis, the visualization of global and local spatial autocorrelation, and spatial regression. A key feature of GeoDa is an interactive environment that combines maps with statistical graphics, using the technology of dynamically linked windows. A brief review of the software design is given, as well as some illustrative examples that highlight distinctive features of the program in applications dealing with public health, economic development, real estate analysis, and criminology.}

abstract="Spatial outliers represent locations which are significantly different from their neighborhoods even though they may not be significantly different from the entire population. Identification of spatial outliers can lead to the discovery of unexpected, interesting, and implicit knowledge, such as local instability. In this paper, we first provide a general definition of S-outliers for spatial outliers. This definition subsumes the traditional definitions of spatial outliers. Second, we characterize the computation structure of spatial outlier detection methods and present scalable algorithms. Third, we provide a cost model of the proposed algorithms. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our algorithms using a Minneapolis-St. Paul (Twin Cities) traffic data set.",

abstract="This paper studies outlier detection and accommodation in general spatial models including spatial autoregressive models and spatial error model as special cases. Using mean-shift and variance-weight models respectively, test statistics for multiple outliers are derived and the detecting procedures are proposed. In addition, several key diagnostic measures such as standardized residuals and leverage measure are defined in general spatial models. Outlier modified models are proposed to accommodate outliers in the data set. The performance of test statistics, including size and power, are examined via simulation studies. Three real examples are analyzed and the results show that the proposed methodology is useful for identifying and accommodating outliers in general spatial models.",

abstract="For many KDD applications finding the outliers, i.e. the rare events, is more interesting and useful than finding the common cases, e.g. detecting criminal activities in E-commerce. Being an outlier, however, is not just a binary property. Instead, it is a property that applies to a certain degree to each object in a data set, depending on how `isolated' this object is, with respect to the surrounding clustering structure. In this paper, we formally introduce a new notion of outliers which bases outlier detection on the same theoretical foundation as density-based cluster analysis. Our notion of an outlier is `local' in the sense that the outlier-degree of an object is determined by taking into account the clustering structure in a bounded neighborhood of the object. We demonstrate that this notion of an outlier is more appropriate for detecting different types of outliers than previous approaches, and we also present an algorithm for finding them. Furthermore, we show that by combining the outlier detection with a density-based method to analyze the clustering structure, we can get the outliers almost for free if we already want to perform a cluster analysis on a data set.",

abstract="This paper deals with finding outliers (exceptions) in large, multidimensional datasets. The identification of outliers can lead to the discovery of truly unexpected knowledge in areas such as electronic commerce, credit card fraud, and even the analysis of performance statistics of professional athletes. Existing methods that we have seen for finding outliers can only deal efficiently with two dimensions/attributes of a dataset. In this paper, we study the notion of DB (distance-based) outliers. Specifically, we show that (i) outlier detection can be done efficiently for large datasets, and for k-dimensional datasets with large values of k (e.g.,                   {\$}k {\backslash}ge 5{\$}                ); and (ii), outlier detection is a meaningful and important knowledge discovery task.",
