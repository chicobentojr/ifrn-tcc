\chapter{IDRs and Outliers}

\section{IDRs}

TODO: brief description about the next subsections

\subsection{User feedback}

TODO: describe about user feedback and its benefit, \textit{implicit and explicit} feedback with examples: gaze track, mouse click, mouse tracking, mouse track polygons, polygons intersections. use some image to demonstrate the idea

\subsection{Interesting Dense Regions}

TODO: describe about Interesting Dense Regions and its usability and advantages based on mouse track polygons. Use the figure from the IDR paper with description.

\subsection{Algorithm}

TODO: Show the used algorithm for IDR detection and explain how it works. present its complexity with pros and cons

\section{Outliers}

TODO: brief description about the next subsections

\subsection{Atypical spatial data}

TODO: explain about the existing process to capture spatial data and its different sources. show the existing spatial datasets with brief descriptions about each one with references. summaries the problems of cleaning datasets and the bad analysis with \textit{noise points}

\subsection{Outliers in GeoGuide}

TODO: explain the utility of detect outliers in GeoGuide and its advantages. describe a practical usage with real datasets examples

\subsection{Algorithm}

TODO: show the selected outlier detection algorithm. use image and explain step by step. explain about its complexity. present its pros and cons.
